# Visual Odometry

## Description

Source code for the mini-project of Vision Algorithm for Mobile Robotics HS20 by Giuliano Albanese and Fausto Tapia.

## Data

This repository only contains source code. The main script expects the datasets to be stored in the **data** folder. Therefore, to run the code you will need to download the three supported datasets to that folder and decompress them. By default, the pipeline is executed on the "Parking Garage" dataset. To test it on KITTI or Malaga, change the **ds** variable in the main script to **0** or **1**.

## System requirements

The code was tested with the following settings:

1) - OS: Windows 10
   - CPU: Intel i5 8th Gen
   - RAM: 8Gb
   - MATLAB version: 2020b
